# Snake

A limited implementation of the classic game of Snake.

## Gameplay

`php snake.php`

Move the snake with the arrow keys. Eat the fruit. Avoid your tail.

To quit during the game, press ESCape. Otherwise your terminal may not be reset properly.

## Requirements

* Terminal with TTY emulation
* PHP 5 (tested with 5.3, but probably works with 5.0+)

## Important Information

Running this will clear your terminal (including scrollback). You've been warned.

This program uses ANSI escape sequences and TTY control commands that are not supported by Windows, even when running a terminal like Git Bash.
